  <raw><![CDATA["People's Daily" and "Guangming Daily" articles denounce new tsars' crimes in Horn of Africa



Peking papers "People's Daily" and "Guangming Daily" today gave prominence to news concerning the 100,000-strong Somali demonstration supporting the abrogation of the Somali-Soviet "friendship treaty", and published articles denouncing the new tsars' crimes in the Horn of Africa.
The "People's Daily" front-paged an article by commentator under the headline "defy brute force, dare to struggle".  it also carried a signed article on its 5th page citing a wealth of facts to expose the old tsars' crimes of infiltration and expansion in the Horn of Africa from the late 19th century to the eve of the october revolution in 1917.  The article emphatically pointed out: "History is like a mirror."  Recalling this period of history, people can clearly see that the infiltrations and expansions of the old tsars and the present-day new tsars in the Horn of Africa run in the same line.  but history is advancing and the people want revolution and nations want liberation.  Africa today is a far ery from the days of yore.  The people in the Horn of Africa are awakening daily.  Their just struggles in unity against hegemony and in defence of independence and state sovereignty are irresistible.  The cry "Russians go home" is resounding throughout the African continent.  In this excellent situation, it is merely wishful thinking for the soviet revisionist new tsars to tread in the footprints of the old tsars, renew their fond dreams and lord it over others in the Horn of Africa excl."

"Guangming Daily" carried a signed article entitled "Black claws of the russian bear have stretched into the Horn of Africa". The article pointed out: "The new tsars have long harboured wild ambitions against the Horn of Africa." "The Soviet social-imperialists have in recent years carried out quite a number of subversive activities in this area." It added: "all these have seriously poisoned the atmosphere in the Horn of Africa, which becomes a source of uneasiness in this area.  In short, to achieve their aim of controlling this strategically important area, the Soviet social-imperialists have deliberately created confusion in order to fish in trouble waters."
The article said in conclusion that the Africa that was manipulated and enslaved by others at will has become a thing of the past.  Africa belongs to the great african people.  The Red Sea will never allow the Russian bear to stir up tumultuous waves of trouble.]]></raw>
